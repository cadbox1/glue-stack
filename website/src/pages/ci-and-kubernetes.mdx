## Docker

- Standard way of shipping services
  - Can easily get a database or prometheus service as a container
- Can deploy the full stack locally with docker-compose
- Infrastructure as code is nice
- We use testcontainers which need to run using docker run, [not docker build](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/1112)
  - Solution is to stop the build after compilation then run the tests then complete the build while skipping those tests
- Multi stage builds
  - Use multi stage builds to reduce container sizes by excluding the dependencies required for building
    - Previously people used a builder image for this which is what older blog posts reference
  - [How to do it in Java](https://whitfin.io/speeding-up-maven-docker-builds/)
  - Use Alpine images because they're smaller
  - Caching multi stage builds - Speeds up build time dramatically - It's tricky - https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715 - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52646303/is-it-possible-to-cache-multi-stage-docker-builds - https://andrewlock.net/caching-docker-layers-on-serverless-build-hosts-with-multi-stage-builds---target,-and---cache-from/

## Kubernetes

- 3 services
  - DB: MySQL database
  - API: Spring Boot API
  - NGINX: Serving frontend assets and proxying the api

- It's nice to have a platform where you can focus on services instead of servers
  - Easy to deploy another service like a redis cache or prometheus for monitoring
  - Deploying locally is pretty close to the production environment so it's easier to reproduce issues
- Use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for local development.
- Docker for Mac has kubernetes now so there's no need for minikube
  - You just need to enable it
  - Integrated with your existing docker credentials
- I used [Kompose](https://kompose.io/) to convert our docker-compose file to Kubernetes resources
  - `brew install kompose`
  - `docker-compose build`
  - `kompose up --build none`
  - `kompose convert`
  - Kompose can also create Helm files too
  - docker-compose is also [available in Kubernetes](https://github.com/docker/compose-on-kubernetes) now but that's a whole other thing
- Deploying with Helm vs kubectl vs other
  - Chose kubectl because it was easy and is ready our of the box.
  - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-stateless-application-deployment/)
  - [Helm](https://helm.sh)
    - Have to install it on your cluster
    - Helm 3 is on the way
    - Potential [security implications](https://medium.com/virtuslab/think-twice-before-using-helm-25fbb18bc822) I didn't want to deal with
  - There's heaps of other [Kubernetes Configuration tools](https://blog.argoproj.io/the-state-of-kubernetes-configuration-management-d8b06c1205) too
- Used sed to specify the docker image to deploy based on the commit hash
- Ingress: [GCE](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-gce) vs [NGINX](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx)
  - GCE
    - Benefits
      - Easy certificates
    - Drawbacks
      - More vendor lockin
      - Can't redirect from http to https
        - [Used NGINX for this](https://serverfault.com/questions/502733/rewrite-http-to-https-with-ngnix-behind-load-balancer)
  - NGINX
    - Benefits
      - Less vendor lockin
      - Can redirect to https - Can be used across namespaces
    - Drawbacks
      - Requires [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) for https
        - Way more complicated than GCE

## GCP

- Best kubernetes support
- Don't charge you for master nodes
- Quite expnsive in the end: ~60 usd/month
  - Free credits will only last a couple months
  - Costs about the same as Elastic Beanstalk in AWS
  - Breakdown
    - (all in Sydney)
    - ~\$25 usd/month for load balancer
    - \$18.24 usd/month for 1 g1-small node
    - ~\$8 usd/month for storage, probably docker images
    - \$8 usd/month for unused static ip address for staging environment
- I like their focus on projects
- Their documentation has a focus on the CLI which made CI slightly easier
- [Install the CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-macos)
- [Staging Cluster vs Staging Namespace](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43212836/multiple-environments-staging-qa-production-etc-with-kubernetes)
  - Chose a seperate staging cluster
  - Easier
  - More isolation
    - Good for load testing
    - Good for testing new Kubernetes versions
  - I wanted to do a staging namespace so I could reuse the existing loadbalancer and save on costs but I couldn't work out how to do it
    - Not so sure now, [might be per rule](https://cloud.google.com/compute/all-pricing#lb)
    - [Reuse existing load balancer GitHub issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-gce/issues/369)
  - I turn it off after merging to save money at the cost of deploy time (~15 mins)
    - They charge you ~\$8 usd/month for unused static ip addresses though
    - It is very cool to spin up clusters as required though - infrastructure as code
  - I had to contact support to get a 2nd static ip address though

## Github Actions

- I setup bash scripts to get CI working locally first
  - Less vendor lockin
  - Faster turnaround times
  - Turns out bash isn't exactly portable
    - GitHub Actions don't support [Bash_Source](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/028)
    - GitHub Actions don't support [pipefail](https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/)
    - [Sed is different on Mac](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5694228/sed-in-place-flag-that-works-both-on-mac-bsd-and-linux)
- Not many blog posts about it since it's still beta
  - you can search for existing open source actions but a lot of them are wrong
- It took me ages to work out how to run the bash scripts inside the [gcloud action](https://github.com/actions/gcloud)
  - you can pull other actions and debug locally since they're just docker files which is nice
- Docker commands behave diffently when run them inside a docker container
  - GitHub Actions use bind mounts so you have to [consider that when dealing with relative paths](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55845723/volume-bind-mounting-from-docker-in-docker)
- Was cool to submit a PR and have it deploy a staging cluster - infrastructure as code
- Pretty fast - builds in about 7mins
- Initially didn't support nested file filters but [now they do](https://github.blog/changelog/2019-09-30-github-actions-event-filtering-updates/)
- Squashing commits means the commit hash won't match from the PR and after you've merged so you have to build again after merging

## Outstanding issues

- Going to run out of GCP credits in ~5 months. Hopefully Azure is cheaper!

## Conclusion

- This was a fair bit of work. - Started in July and finished in September - Only have a few hours a week for my side projects
- Had to make a lot of uneducated decisions
- Really rewarding to finish it off and see it working
- Knowing my credits will expire in a couple months makes me sad. Hopefully it doesn't come around
- This whole thing really goes to show how terrible programming can be sometimes

## Honerable Mentions

- [GitLab auto devops](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/)
  - Would need to customise it a lot for a monorepo and testcontainers
  - Expects a single container
  - would have to leave Github or setup a mirror
- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/kubernetes/)
  - Infrastructure as code across platforms.
  - Can provision services inside and outside of Kubernetes
