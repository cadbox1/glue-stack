## The Stack

Multitenant, monolithic, 3-tier application with a MySQL database, Spring Boot HTTP API and React Single Page Application.

| Component                                 | Type                            | Language   | Implementation                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| DB \(Database\)                           | Relational                      | SQL        | MySQL \(pronounced "my sequel"\) |
| API \(Application Programming Interface\) | JSON over HTTP                  | Java       | Spring Boot                      |
| UI \(User Interface\)                     | SPA \(Single Page Application\) | Javascript | React                            |

## Responsibilities

| Component | Where it runs                                    | Storage & Retrieval | Security | Navigation |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| DB        | Private server \(cloud\)                         | yes                 |          |            |
| API       | Public server \(internet facing\) \(cloud\)      | yes                 | yes      |            |
| UI        | Internet browsers \(desktop and mobile devices\) | yes                 |          | yes        |

You can see the separation in responsbility here but I also want to highlighting the sharing of responsbility with storing and retrieving data.

## Tools and Libraries

SQL, Java, Javascript, HTML and CSS are still the most popular technologies among developers in 2018. [Most Popular Technologies, Developer Survey Results - Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#most-popular-technologies) and I know them pretty well.
