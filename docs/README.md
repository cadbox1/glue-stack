# Glue Stack

My stack of favourite tools and practises glued together to make a multi-tenant todo application where organisations can manage their tasks.

## Why

* To share how I build web applications, for both my future self and others.
* Show why I think a monolithic SQL, Java application is still cool.
* Demonstrate my idea of development process documentation.

## Getting Started

* Check out the [app](https://d1if23x0agu0jj.cloudfront.net/).
* We have a [pretty website](https://cadbox1.github.io/glue-stack/).
* Check out our [development process](./Guides/DevelopmentProcess-Tasks.md).
* Check out our [chat](https://spectrum.chat/glue-stack).
* Check out our [designs](./Design/README.md).
* Check out our [guides](./Guides/README.md).
* [Run locally](./Guides/RunningLocally.md).
* Check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/cadbox1/glue-stack/projects/3).
* If you're really keen then [build Glue Stack from an empty folder](./Guides/BuildingGlueStackFromAnEmptyFolder.md).


## Architecture

Multitenant, monolithic, 3-tier application with a MySQL database, Spring Boot HTTP API and React Single Page Application.

| Tier/Component                            | Type                            | Language   | Implementation                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| DB \(Database\)                           | Relational                      | SQL        | MySQL \(pronounced "my sequel"\) |
| API \(Application Programming Interface\) | JSON over HTTP                  | Java       | Spring Boot                      |
| UI \(User Interface\)                     | SPA \(Single Page Application\) | Javascript | React                            |

## Application Features

* Sign up your organisation
* Login and Logout
* Manage your assigned tasks
* Manage your organisation's tasks
* Manage your users

## Managing Resources

The term `CRUD` (Create, Rertrieve, Update, Delete) often simplifies the problem. I prefer to think of it as `Managing Resources`

* Operations
  * Retrieval
    * Viewing a single resource
    * Collections
      * Searching
      * Filtering
      * Sorting
      * Pagination
  * Storage
    * Create
    * Edit
    * Delete
* Security
  * Authentication: Users must be logged in so we can check authorisations
  * Authorisation
    * Multi-tenancy: users can only manage resources in their own organisation
    * Permissions: different users can access different resources within their organisation
    * Feature toggles: developers can toggle different features or operations for an organisation

AND Mobile friendly: all operations must work across devices.

The `Managing Resouces` pattern will be used over and over again in our app so it is vital that we design our application to address it, especially the development process documentation.

## Tools

### Stack Tools

Tools that make our application work.

SQL, Java, Javascript, HTML and CSS are still the most popular technologies among developers in 2018. [Most Popular Technologies, Developer Survey Results - Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#most-popular-technologies). Most of my programming has been done with these tools so I have a good idea of how they can work together.

* Database
  * [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL)
* API
  * [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
  * [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#overview)
  * [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/)
  * [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security)
  * [Spring Data JPA](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/)
* UI
  * [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  * [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
  * [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
  * [React Router V4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)

### Development Tools

Tools that we use to develop our application over time.

* Version Control
  * Git
  * Monorepo
  * [Git Town](http://www.git-town.com/)
* Editors
  * [Visual Studio Code \(vscode\)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/)
* Documentation
  * Development process documentation
* Deployment
  * [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) for automated database migrations.
