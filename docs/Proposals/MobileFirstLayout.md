# Mobile First Layout

- most apps opt for a web app and a mobile app. this means double the development for new features.
- we have implemented a sidebar which can be toggled at anytime but by default is shown on desktop and hidden on mobile
- new pages appear on the right in a split screen mode if there's room otherwise just the new page is displayed on mobiled
- subsequent navigations on the present page only navigate that split of the screen, the root page remains the same.
- it is something similar to google tag manager and azure ad
