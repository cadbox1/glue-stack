# Performance Monitoring

Lots of tools to choose from.

- Sentry is very good for error aggregation and is cheap but doesn't do performance analysis
- NewRelic is the tried and tested service but is quite expensive and a bit clunky
- Spring Boot now has micrometer so you could host your own metrics but that seems difficult
- Lots of other options
